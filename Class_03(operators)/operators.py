# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# 1.Arithmetic operators
# 2.Assignment operators
# 3.Comparison operators
# 4.Logical operators
# 5.Identity operators
# 6.Membership operators
# 7.Bitwise operators

# Arthimetic_Operator_01
# 1. Addition +
# 2. Subsctraction -
# 3.Multiplication *
# 4.Division /
# 5.Exponent **
# 6.Modulus %
# 7.Floor//

# 1. Addition (+)
# Ten=10
# Five=5
# Add=Ten+Five
# print("Addition",Ten,"+",Five,"=",Ten)

# 2. Subsctraction (-)
# Four=4
# Two=2
# Sub=Four-Two
# print("Substraction",Four,"-",Two,"=",Sub)

# 3.Multiplication (*)
# Six=6
# Three=3
# Multi=Six*Three
# print("Multilple",Six,"*",Three,"=",Multi)

# 4.Division (/)
# ten=10
# three=3
# deci=ten/three
# print("Division",ten,"/",three,"=",deci)

# 5.Exponent **
# five=5
# two=2
# Expo=five**two
# print("Exponent",five,"**",two,"=",Expo)

# 6.Modulus %
# TwentlyFivee=25
# Three=3
# mod=TwentlyFivee%Three
# print(TwentlyFivee,"%",Three,"=",mod,"(Modulus Also called Reminder)")

# 7.Floor//
# twentlyFivee=30
# three=3
# floor=twentlyFivee//three
# print(twentlyFivee,"//",three,"=",floor,"(Floor division also called Times of table)")

# Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
# 1.  (=)   Equal
# 2.  (+=)  Addition
# 3.  (-=)  Subtraction
# 4.  (*=)  Multiplication
# 5.  (/=)  Devision
# 5.  (%=)  Modulus For Reminder
# 6.  (//=) Floor division for times of table
# 7.  (**=) Exponentiation for Power use
# 8.  (&=)
# 9.  (|=)
# 10. (^=)
# 11. (>>=)
# 12. (<<=)

# Example 1.    (=)
# x=10
# print(x)
